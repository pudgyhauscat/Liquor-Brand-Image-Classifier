# Liquor Brand Image Classifier

This project uses a neural network to classify images associated with a set of liquor brands in Google Images. The project makes use of two data sets.
The first data set is made up of 250 images. These images were downloaded by hand for two reasons. The first reason is that at the time of the project
many python image scraping tools had broken due to a change on Google's side. The second reason was to ensure that the images included in the data set
were (1) liquor bottles or liquor branding, (2) not tangentially related to the liquor brand. The larger data set made use of a chrome extension that 
allowed for mass downloading of images. This tool was a blunt instrument. For example, the following two images were included in the subset associated with
Glenfiddich.
